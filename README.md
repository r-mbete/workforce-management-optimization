# Optimizing Workforce Management Through Machine Learning Employee Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to use machine learning to classify employees and improve workforce management decisions. We are comparing multiple algorithms to find the best model for classification.

## Algorithms Used
1. Decision Tree
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Neural Networks
4. XGBoost (to be added)

## Goal
The goal is to train these models effectively to achieve high classification accuracy, with a focus on optimizing workforce management outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as age, tenure, role, department, and other employee attributes. The target variable represents a classification outcome related to employee behavior.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   
## Issues and Assistance Needed
Currently, I'm encountering challenges with model training and tuning, particularly with XGBoost. Any suggestions or contributions are greatly appreciated!
